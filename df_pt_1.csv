As an arts school, LoMA integrates visual and performance elements into the curriculum through three approaches. Students have the opportunity to work with artists during academic classes to create high quality, standards-based performances of learning. Our school has partnerships with many Lower East Side arts organizations so that every student takes part in an Extended Day Program at least twice a week.

They begin with introductory research classes in the earlier grades, and grow in complexity as students develop more advanced skills and understanding. Science research, for example, begins in 9th grade with honors experimental research biology, continues with similar high-level courses in chemistry & physics, and culminates in the senior Intel/Siemens research competition class. In addition, a wide array of science electives enhances students' academic opportunities in these field. This highly successful sequential approach has resulted in 13 Intel semifinalists (and the 3rd-place national winner) in 2012 and ten semifinalists in 2013, leading the nation in this category for both years., Chancellor’s Arts Endorsed Diploma",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,http://stuy.edu,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,1.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,1.0,345 Chambers Street,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,"Basketball, Bowling, Cross Country, Fencing, Golf, Gymnastics, Handball, Indoor Track, Lacrosse, Outdoor Track, Soccer, Softball, Swimming, Tennis, Volleyball & JV Volleyball",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3:30 PM,1.0,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,"M20, M22, M5, M9, S1115",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,679,0.0,0.0,0.0
